# Machine Learning algorithms with ski-kit

This are a list of programs implementing machine learning algorithms, for the purpose of submission to entries in the "Housing Prices" Competition conducted by Kaggle. The programs implement different methods of evaluation, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoosting, to properly fit the model. Data cleaning and formatting is also implemented, as the dataset is split and properly dropped and fitted as required.
